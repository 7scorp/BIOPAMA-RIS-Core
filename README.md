# BIOPAMA-RIS-Configuration

## How to customise the RIS

This repo contains the configuration files for the BIOPAMA RIS that need to be changed if the RIS is to be customised for a region

The **DEFAULT_map_settings.js MUST be renamed to map_settings.js** to ensure that the settings are not replaced if there is an update to the configuration options at a later date. And to acctually make it work since the RIS is looking for map_settings.js.
